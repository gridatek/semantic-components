# Semantic Components

A collection of accessible, customizable UI components for Angular applications.

## Features

### Modern Angular Architecture

- **Angular 21+** with standalone components (no NgModules)
- **Signals** for reactive state management
- **OnPush change detection** for optimal performance
- **TypeScript-first** with strict type safety

### Declarative

- **State-driven UI** - Control components through template bindings, not imperative methods
- **No .open() calls** - Use `[open]="signal()"` instead of `dialog.open()`
- **Template-based** - Everything lives in your templates, easy to see and understand
- **Reactive by default** - UI automatically updates with your state

### Composable

- **Specialized components** instead of one monolithic component with many inputs
- **Slot-based patterns** - Compose UIs by nesting components together
- **Maximum flexibility** - Build exactly what you need without prop drilling
- **Single responsibility** - Each component has one clear purpose

### Accessibility First

- **WCAG AA compliant** with full keyboard navigation
- **ARIA attributes** and semantic HTML
- **Focus management** and screen reader support
- **Color contrast** and responsive touch targets

### Modern Styling

- **Tailwind CSS 4** for utility-first styling
- **CSS custom properties** for easy theming
- **Dark mode support** built-in
- **Responsive design** with mobile-first approach

### Developer Experience
