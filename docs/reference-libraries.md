# Reference libraries

For a component shadcn/ui doesn't have, the libraries we follow: what they do,
what we took, and what is still open. We follow their behaviour and layout —
never their CSS; the look stays ours (shadcn's tokens).

Check them before deciding how a component behaves — don't guess.

## Video Player

**Taken:**

- **A small layout below 576px of the player's width** (Vidstack's breakpoint; Tailwind's `@xl` container size): captions at the top (`scVideoPlayerTop`), play in the middle (`scVideoPlayerCenter`), time, title and fullscreen at the bottom (`scVideoPlayerBar`), the seek bar at the bottom edge. Out of it: the skips, mute, the volume slider, the speeds, picture-in-picture. The parts do it themselves (`@container/video`), not the template.
- **Before the first play** (Vidstack's start duration): the poster, play and the length only (`scVideoPlayerStartDuration`); the controls from the first play on.
- **The controls hide only while playing,** after a rest; paused, they stay (both).
- **On a touch screen, a tap on the playing video shows or hides the controls** — it doesn't pause (Vidstack, and the phones' own players).
- **Ended: Replay** in place of Play.

**Open — to follow them later:**

- **A settings menu** (Vidstack's, top bar of the small layout): the speeds — and captions, quality — in a menu, so a small player keeps them.
- **Volume as a pop-up** on the mute button (Vidstack), instead of a slider in the bar.
- **The hide delay: 2 s** (both); ours is 2.5 s.
- **Keep the controls while the pointer rests on them** (Media Chrome: not hidden while hovered); ours hide unless one has focus.
- **Hide when the pointer leaves the player** — an option in Vidstack (`hideOnMouseLeave`, off by default).
- **A medium layout** (Media Chrome, 420–590px): the center controls and the bar together.
